# GeoMines
A simple Android game where each player is a given a target to kill in the beginning of each game. A kill is awarded by walking to a real world location and planting a mine (based on GPS). If the target happens to walk into the mine, the player gains a point and targets are reassigned.

## Limitations
- Can use radar a limited amount of times to find bombs nearby
- One bomb awarded per hours
- Given 5 days to complete a contract
- Given a target and list of friendlys (which you shouldn't kill)
- Killing friendlys causes you to be put on their hitlist (they are awarded points for killing you, in addition to their target)
- You can defuse bombs through some (undecided) process
